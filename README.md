## Why Mission Control?

AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) are powerful executors — but managing multiple agents across multiple projects is chaos. There's no shared task board, no inbox, no way to see who's working on what or whether they finished.

**Mission Control gives your AI agents structure.** Agents get roles, inboxes, and reporting protocols. You delegate work through a visual dashboard, they execute and report back. You stay in control without micromanaging.

**Prioritize**

Eisenhower matrix tells you what matters. Drag-and-drop tasks between Do, Schedule, Delegate, and Eliminate.

**Delegate**

Assign tasks to AI agents. They get notified, pick up work, and post completion reports to your inbox.

<td align="center" width="33%">

**Supervise**

Dashboard, inbox, decisions queue. See every agent's workload, read their reports, answer their questions.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> **How is this different from Linear, Asana, or Notion?** Mission Control was built **agent-first**. Agents read and write tasks through a token-optimized API, report progress to your inbox, and ask you for decisions. You manage outcomes, not keystrokes. And it runs locally — no cloud dependency, no API keys, no vendor lock-in.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Why | Install |
|-------------|-----|---------|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20+ | Runtime | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) v9+ | Package manager | `npm install -g pnpm` |
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) *(recommended)* | Agent automation (Launch button, daemon, slash commands) | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |

> The web UI works standalone for task management, prioritization, and goal tracking. Claude Code is needed to **execute** tasks via agents. Any AI coding tool that can access local files (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) can also participate — see [Works With](#works-with) below.

### Install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MeisnerDan/mission-control.git
cd mission-control/mission-control   # repo folder → app folder (where package.json lives)
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and click **"Load Demo Data"** to see it in action with sample tasks, agents, and messages.

### What to Try First

1. **Explore the dashboard** — see task counts, agent workloads, and recent activity at a glance
2. **Drag tasks** on the Priority Matrix — move tasks between Do, Schedule, Delegate, and Eliminate
3. **Click a task card** to open the detail panel — edit description, subtasks, and acceptance criteria
4. **Click the 🚀 Launch button** on a task assigned to an agent — spawns a Claude Code session that executes the work (requires Claude Code)
5. **Open Claude Code in this workspace** and run `/daily-plan` to see slash commands in action

---

## How It Works

Mission Control stores all data in local JSON files. No database, no cloud dependency. AI agents interact by reading and writing these files — the same source of truth the web UI uses.

### The Agent Loop

```
1. You create a task          ──>  Assign to an agent role (e.g., Researcher)
2. Press play (or daemon)     ──>  Spawns a Claude Code session with agent persona
3. Agent executes             ──>  Does the work, updates progress
4. Mission Control completes  ──>  Auto-marks done, posts report, logs activity
5. You review                 ──>  Read reports in inbox, answer questions
```

Multiple agents can work in parallel across different tasks. **Continuous missions** take this further — click the rocket button on a project to run all tasks until done. As each task completes, the next batch auto-dispatches, respecting dependency chains and concurrency limits. If an agent gets stuck, loop detection escalates to you after 3 failures. The **daemon** (`pnpm daemon:start`) adds 24/7 background automation, polling for new tasks and running scheduled commands on cron schedules.

### Testing

Mission Control includes **193 automated tests** across 3 suites:

```bash
pnpm test        # Run all tests
pnpm check       # Typecheck + lint
pnpm verify      # Full verification: typecheck + lint + build + test
```

| Suite | Tests | Covers |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Validation** | 90 | All 17 Zod schemas — field defaults, constraints, edge cases |
| **Daemon** | 42 | Security (credential scrubbing, path validation, binary whitelist), config loading, prompt builder, types |
| **Data Layer** | 19 | Read/write operations, file I/O, mutex safety, archive |
| **Agent Flow** | 17 | End-to-end: task creation → delegation → inbox → decisions → activity log |
| **Security** | 25 | API auth, rate limiting, token/origin validation, CSRF protection |

---

## Agent API

Every API endpoint is designed for minimal token consumption. Your agents spend tokens doing work, not parsing bloated payloads.

```bash
# Get only your in-progress tasks (~50 tokens vs ~5,400 for everything)
GET /api/tasks?assignedTo=developer&kanban=in-progress

# Sparse fields — return only what you need
GET /api/tasks?fields=id,title,kanban

# Get just the DO quadrant (important + urgent)
GET /api/tasks?quadrant=do

# Paginated results with metadata
GET /api/tasks?limit=10&offset=0
# → { data: [...], meta: { total: 47, filtered: 47, returned: 10, limit: 10, offset: 0 } }

# Compressed context — entire workspace state in ~650 tokens
# (vs ~10,000+ for raw JSON files)
pnpm gen:context  # outputs data/ai-context.md
```

```bash
# Run a single task — spawns a Claude Code session
POST /api/tasks/:id/run

# Run all eligible tasks in a project as a continuous mission
POST /api/projects/:id/run

# Stop a running mission (kills all processes, resets tasks)
POST /api/projects/:id/stop

# Stop a single running task
POST /api/tasks/:id/stop

# Get live status of all active runs
GET /api/runs

# Get mission status (with auto-reconciliation of stuck missions)
GET /api/missions
```

All write endpoints use **Zod validation** (malformed data returns field-level errors) and **async-mutex locking** (concurrent writes from multiple agents queue safely, never corrupt data).

## Built-In Agents

| Role | Handles | Assign when... |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Me** | Decisions, approvals, creative direction | Requires human judgment |
| **Researcher** | Market research, competitive analysis, evaluation | Needs investigation |
| **Developer** | Code, bug fixes, testing, deployment | Technical implementation |
| **Marketer** | Copy, growth strategy, content, SEO | Marketing/content work |
| **Business Analyst** | Strategy, planning, prioritization, financials | Analysis/strategy work |
| **+ Custom** | Anything you define | Create via `/crew/new` with custom instructions |

Agents are fully editable — change their name, instructions, capabilities, and linked skills at any time through the Crew UI or by editing `data/agents.json` directly.

---

## Slash Commands

Run these in any [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) session opened in this workspace:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/standup` | Daily standup from git + tasks + inbox + activity |
| `/daily-plan` | Top priorities + inbox check + decisions + brain dump triage |
| `/weekly-review` | Accomplishments + goal progress + stale items |
| `/orchestrate` | Coordinate all agents — spawn sub-agents for pending tasks |
| `/brainstorm` | Generate creative ideas on a topic |
| `/research` | Web research with structured markdown output |
| `/plan-feature` | Break a feature into tasks + create milestone |
| `/ship-feature` | Test, lint, commit + update task status + post report |
| `/pick-up-work` | Check inbox for new assignments, pick highest priority |
| `/report` | Post a status update or completion report |
| `/researcher` | Activate researcher agent persona |
| `/marketer` | Activate marketer agent persona |
| `/business-analyst` | Activate business analyst persona |

### Daemon Commands

```bash
pnpm daemon:start    # Start the autonomous daemon (background process)
pnpm daemon:stop     # Stop the daemon gracefully
pnpm daemon:status   # Show daemon status, active sessions, and stats
```

The daemon runs as a background Node.js process, polling `tasks.json` for pending work and spawning Claude Code sessions via `claude -p`. It enforces concurrency limits, retries failed tasks, and runs scheduled commands (daily-plan, standup, weekly-review) on cron schedules. Monitor everything from the `/daemon` dashboard.

> **Note on authentication:** The daemon spawns Claude Code directly via `claude -p` — it does not extract or transmit OAuth tokens, make raw API calls, or use the Agent SDK. Your Claude account credentials stay within Claude Code's own authentication layer, the same as running `claude -p` from your terminal. This is local automation of an official Anthropic product, not a third-party integration.

### Design Decisions

- **Local-first** — No database, no cloud, no API keys. Your data stays on your machine in plain JSON files.
- **JSON as IPC** — Humans (web UI) and agents (file reads + API) share the same source of truth. No sync layer needed.
- **BYOAI** — Works with any agent that can read files: Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or a custom script.
- **Zod + Mutex** — All API writes are validated with Zod schemas and serialized with async-mutex to prevent data corruption during concurrent multi-agent operations.

### Works With

Mission Control runs locally and integrates with AI coding tools through the filesystem and CLI:

- **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** — Open this workspace in Claude Code to use slash commands (`/orchestrate`, `/daily-plan`, `/standup`, etc.) and let agents read/write task data directly.
- **[Claude Cowork](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-cowork)** — Cowork agents can use Mission Control as a tool by reading the workspace's `CLAUDE.md` and JSON data files directly — no special plugin required.
- **Any file-aware agent** — Cursor, Windsurf, or custom scripts can read the JSON data files and call the API endpoints to participate in the agent loop.
